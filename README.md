# Node.js Learning Project

Welcome to my Node.js learning revision journey! This repository will document my progress as I continue to explore and master Node.js. Each day, I'll be working on different concepts, examples, and projects to understand how to work with Node.js and its various features.

## Introduction

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, designed for building fast, scalable network applications. It is asynchronous, event-driven, and allows for running JavaScript on the server-side.

This repository is a personal project to track my progress in learning Node.js. It contains code examples, exercises, and mini-projects that demonstrate different aspects of Node.js.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   - Open your terminal and run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nodejs-learning-project.git
     ```
   - Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Install Node.js:**
   - Visit the [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org) and download the latest LTS version.
   - After installation, check the versions of Node.js and npm by running the following commands:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - If any dependencies are listed in `package.json`, you can install them by running:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

## Usage

1. **Running the Project:**
   - To start coding in Node.js, create JavaScript files in this repository and run them using Node.js.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     node app.js
     ```

2. **Basic Example:**
   - A basic example to get started with the `app.js` file:
     ```javascript
     console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
     ```
   - To run this script, use the command:
     ```bash
     node app.js
     ```

3. **File System Example:**
   - Node.js provides the `fs` (file system) module for file operations. Here is an example of writing to a file:
     ```javascript
     const fs = require('fs');

     fs.writeFile('example.txt', 'Hello, Node.js file!', (err) => {
         if (err) throw err;
         console.log('File has been written!');
     });
     ```
   - Run the script using:
     ```bash
     node file-example.js
     ```

## Learning Journey

This section will track the learning progress, broken down by day.

  - Running your first script.
  - Introduction to the `fs` module for file operations.
  
- **Goals:**
  - Install Node.js and get comfortable running basic scripts.
  - Write a "Hello, Node.js!" script and experiment with basic file handling.
  
- **Resources:**
  - [Official Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
  - [Node.js Tutorials on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/)

### Day 2: Node.js Modules & npm
